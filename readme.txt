This is a work in progress for a visual programming style puzzle game that will use bitwise operations
Currently there is one part of the user interface implemented, that being the actual interaction with 
the Blocks that will perform functions, there is also a fully implemented scaling layer that interacts
with the user's mouse.
There is not an implementation of user interaction with the Nodes connected to the blocks yet, however
there will be soon. 

The Block class will be extended with classes for >>, &, ^, |, !
These should be easy to extend with the class system I have currently in place. 
There may also be classes for levels and/or gamestates.
