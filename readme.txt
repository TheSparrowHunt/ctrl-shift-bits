This is a work in progress for a visual programming style puzzle game that will use bitwise operations
Currently there is one part of the user interface implemented, that being the actual interaction with 
the Blocks that will perform functions, there is also a fully implemented scaling layer that interacts
with the user's mouse.

This is mostly a framework for one part of the game, the actual connection blocks, nodes and connections.
I do plan on finishsing this program later.
